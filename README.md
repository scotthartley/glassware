# glassware: A repository of vector images of glassware

This repo is simply a set of images, in pdf format, of chemistry glassware. Useful for creating diagrams for exams and other teaching applications.

If you have requests, I'm happy to consider them (please post an issue). Contributions are welcome, so long as they are based on the same set of pieces to keep the look, size, and fit consistent.
